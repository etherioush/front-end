        <h2>Why are you all so down</h2>
        <p>What's the problem say something<br>
            The atmosphere is so cold. Is this a trend these days<br>
            Why aren't you all that funny? Oh, that's the same for me<br>
            Tell me what I got to do Turn on Bluetooth as soon as possible<br>
            Just play any song. Anything exciting<br>
            Just dance whatever you want to make it look like it's nothing<br>
            I don't want to think about anything. I want to live with anything for a while<br>
            I'm sick and tired of my every day, keep it up<br>
            <br>
            Just play any song. Whatever. It's so boring<br>
            I think it's urgent to refresh, so the stress is building up<br>
            It's a day I want to laugh so hard that I can't stop laughing<br>
            What up my dawgs? Where are you? Get some bottled beer and crackers when you come. Uh<br>
            I don't really like clubbing. Come to my living room quickly<br>
            <br>
            I'm not gonna have enough time to chat all night<br>
            Someone's going to die and someone's festival, I want my your back<br>
            One by one, you're going to cut me off after a while<br>
            Why are you all so down? What's the problem? Say something<br>
