        What's the problem say something<br>
        The atmosphere is so cold. Is this a trend these days<br>
        Why aren't you all that funny? Oh, that's the same for me<br>
        Tell me what I got to do Turn on Bluetooth as soon as possible<br>
        Just play any song. Anything exciting<br>
        Just dance whatever you want to make it look like it's nothing<br>
        I don't want to think about anything. I want to live with anything for a while<br>
        I'm sick and tired of my every day, keep it up<br>
        <br>
        Just play any song. Whatever. It's so boring<br>
        I think it's urgent to refresh, so the stress is building up<br>
        It's a day I want to laugh so hard that I can't stop laughing<br>
        What up my dawgs? Where are you? Get some bottled beer and crackers when you come. Uh<br>
        I don't really like clubbing. Come to my living room quickly<br>
        <br>
        I'm not gonna have enough time to chat all night<br>
        Someone's going to die and someone's festival, I want my your back<br>
        One by one, you're going to cut me off after a while<br>
        Why are you all so down? What's the problem? Say something<br>
